 ## 
 Objective
 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset (or any dataset) to understand data
 using statistics and visualizations.
 ## 
 Tools Used
 1 Python
 2 Pandas
 3 Matplotlib
 4 Seaborn
 ## 
 Steps Performed
 1 Data Loading – Imported Titanic dataset.
 2 Summary Statistics – Mean, median, std, min, max, etc.
 3 Missing Value Analysis – Checked null values.
 4 Visualizations: Histograms, Boxplots, Correlation Heatmap, Pairplots.
 ## 
 Outputs
 All plots are saved in the outputs/ folder: histograms.png, boxplots.png, correlation_heatmap.png,
 pairplot.png.

 Interview Questions & Answers
 1. What is the purpose of EDA?
 EDA helps to understand the dataset’s structure, detect patterns, identify anomalies, and decide the
 right preprocessing & modeling techniques.
 2. How do boxplots help in understanding a dataset?
 Boxplots show the spread, median, quartiles, and outliers of numerical data, making it easier to
 detect skewness and extreme values.
 3. What is correlation and why is it useful?
 Correlation measures the linear relationship between variables. It helps identify redundant features
 and select important ones.
 4. How do you detect skewness in data?
 By checking histograms, skewness value (df.skew()), or boxplots.
 5. What is multicollinearity?
When two or more independent variables are highly correlated, making it hard to estimate their
 effects accurately in models.
 6. What tools do you use for EDA?
 Common tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Power BI, Excel.
 7. Can you explain a time when EDA helped you find a problem?
 Example: In the Titanic dataset, EDA revealed missing Age values and outliers in Fare, which
 needed treatment before modeling.
 8. What is the role of visualization in ML?
 Visualizations simplify data understanding, highlight hidden patterns, and guide feature engineering
 for better ML performance.
